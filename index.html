                <p class="deneme"> Amsterdam is beautiful and loved by many professional and amateur photographers, so there’s many pictures floating around on the internet… not all of them are gems, but most are certainly enjoyable to look at. Because there’s so many pictures of the city I decided to have  look and see if I can make a cool collection of what I think are among the best pictures of Amsterdam out there. I’ve picked out 18 of the most stunning photo’s I could find. I’m quite sure you’ll be amazed!</p>

The rooms are on an enclosed courtyard behind a 17th-century canal house that served as the Dutch HQs of the spice and gelling companies Frank’s father Otto worked for.</p>
